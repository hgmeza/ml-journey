# ml-journey
Journey of learning ML and AI by starting with the basics and trying to understand the maths behind ML algorithms.

By always having the thrive to learn more, I think that these Udemy courses are relevant for not only teaching the practical or mechanical way of using ML/AI algorithms, but also the theoretical part, which most online courses dont teach.
